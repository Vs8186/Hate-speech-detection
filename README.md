Hate Speech Detection

Overview:

This project is focused on detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning. The dataset is provided in CSV format, containing labeled text samples categorized as hate speech or not. The model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify text input.

Features:

Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization)

Training a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or other ML models)

Saving and loading the trained model for predictions

Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Dataset:

The dataset is in CSV format and contains the following columns:

text: The input text sample

label: The classification label (e.g., 0 for non-hate speech, 1 for hate speech)
